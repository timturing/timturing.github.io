When we use the python to get web pages, most if them are static. However, some of them are dynamic. For example, the web page is generated by javascript. In this case, we can use selenium to get the dynamic page. (Another simple way is to use the developer tool in the browser to analyse the API that return the json file, but this is not fit for login situation.)

## Install selenium
```bash
pip install selenium
```

## Install webdriver
We need to install the webdriver for the browser we use. For example, if we use chrome, we need to install the chromedriver. The chromedriver can be downloaded from [here](https://chromedriver.chromium.org/downloads). After download, we need to add the path of the chromedriver to the environment variable or simply set it in the code.
```python
from selenium import webdriver
driver = webdriver.Chrome(executable_path='/path/to/chromedriver')
```

## Get the dynamic page
To get the dynamically loaded page, we will meet with 2 key problems: 1. the element we want to get is not loaded completely. 2. the element is not loaded until we scroll down the page. To solve the first problem, we can use the `WebDriverWait` function. To solve the second problem, we can use the `ActionChains` function.
```python
from selenium.webdriver.common.action_chains import ActionChains
from selenium.webdriver.common.by import By
from selenium.webdriver.support.ui import WebDriverWait
from selenium.webdriver.support import expected_conditions as EC
driver = webdriver.Chrome(executable_path='/path/to/chromedriver')
driver.get('https://www.example.com')

# wait until the element is loaded
element = WebDriverWait(driver, 10).until(
    EC.presence_of_element_located((By.ID, 'element_id'))
)

# scroll down the page
actions = ActionChains(driver)
actions.move_to_element(element).perform()
```


## Caveat ‚ùó 
If there is frame in the page, we need to switch to the frame first.
```python
iframe = WebDriverWait(driver, 10).until(
        EC.presence_of_element_located((By.ID, 'login-iframe'))
    )
driver.switch_to.frame(iframe)
```
