## Test original things

This is my first time to use Jekyll and Github Pages to build my personal blog. I will try to write some blogs about my research and life.


## Test some math equations
single dollar sign: $x^2+y^2=1$

$$
\begin{aligned}
\frac{\partial u}{\partial t} + \nabla \cdot \left( u \otimes u \right) &= - \nabla p + \nabla \cdot \left( \mu \left( \nabla u + \nabla u^T \right) \right) + f \\
\nabla \cdot u &= 0
\end{aligned}
$$

## Test some code
```python
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

x = np.linspace(0, 2*np.pi, 100)
```

## Test some tables
| Tables        | Are           | Cool  |
| ------------- |:-------------:| -----:|
| col 3 is      | right-aligned | $1600 |
| col 2 is      | centered      |   $12 |
| zebra stripes | are neat      |    $1 |

## Test some footnotes
Here's a simple footnote,[^1] and here's a longer one.[^bignote]

[^1]: This is the first footnote.
[^bignote]: Here's one with multiple paragraphs and code.

    Indent paragraphs to include them in the footnote.

    `{ my code }`

    Add as many paragraphs as you like.
