When using git to collaborate with each other, we need to find a easy way to contribute with each other. In this post, I will show you the full steps to achieve this.

## 1. Fork the repository
First, you need to fork the repository to your own account. You can do this by clicking the "Fork" button on the top right corner of the repository page.

## 2. Sync and pull the repository
Before you do some update in your local repository, you need to sync the remote repository first so that your forked repository is up-to-date. Then you can pull the repository to your local machine. This keep sure that you are working on the latest version of the repository.

## 3. Do some changes
Now you can do some changes in your local repository. You can add new files, modify existing files, or delete some files. After you finish your changes, you can commit your changes to your local repository.

## 4. Push the changes to your forked repository
After you commit your changes to your local repository, you can push the changes to your forked repository. This will update your forked repository with your changes.

## 5. Create a pull request
After you push your changes to your forked repository, you can create a pull request to the original repository. You can do this by clicking the "New pull request" button on the original repository page. Then you can compare the changes between your forked repository and the original repository, and create a pull request.
