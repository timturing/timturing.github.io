### Introduction to `rsync`

`rsync` (Remote Sync) is a fast and versatile command-line utility for synchronizing files and directories between two locations over a network or locally. It is known for its efficiency in transferring only the differences between the source and destination, rather than copying entire files.

### Common `rsync` Arguments

- `-a` or `--archive`: Enables archive mode, which ensures that symbolic links, devices, attributes, permissions, ownerships, and timestamps are preserved. It is equivalent to `-rlptgoD`.
- `-v` or `--verbose`: Provides verbose output, showing the details of the transfer.
- `-z` or `--compress`: Compresses file data during the transfer.
- `-h`: Human readable version.
- `-P`: Combines `--progress` and `--partial` to show progress during the transfer and keep partially transferred files.
- `--delete`: Deletes files from the destination directory that are no longer present in the source directory.
- `--exclude=PATTERN`: Excludes files matching the pattern from being transferred.
- `--include=PATTERN`: Includes files matching the pattern for transfer.
- `-e`: Specifies the remote shell to use, such as SSH (e.g., `-e ssh`).
- `--dry-run`: Performs a trial run without making any changes, useful for testing what will happen.
- `-r` or `--recursive`: Recursively transfers directories.
- `--checksum`: Uses checksum to decide which files need to be updated, instead of using the default `time and size` check.

### Common Usage Examples

#### 1. Synchronizing Directories Locally
```bash
rsync -av /source/directory/ /destination/directory/
```
This command synchronizes the contents of `/source/directory` to `/destination/directory`, preserving all file attributes and providing verbose output.

#### 2. Synchronizing Directories Over SSH
```bash
rsync -avz -e ssh /local/directory/ user@remotehost:/remote/directory/
```
This command synchronizes `/local/directory` to `/remote/directory` on a remote host using SSH, with compression enabled to save bandwidth.

#### 3. Deleting Files in the Destination that are No Longer in the Source
```bash
rsync -av --delete /source/directory/ /destination/directory/
```
This command ensures that `/destination/directory` is an exact mirror of `/source/directory`, deleting any files in the destination that do not exist in the source.

#### 4. Excluding Specific Files
```bash
rsync -av --exclude='*.tmp' /source/directory/ /destination/directory/
```
This command synchronizes the directories but excludes all files ending with `.tmp`.

#### 5. Including and Excluding Patterns
```bash
rsync -av --include='*.jpg' --exclude='*' /source/directory/ /destination/directory/
```
This command includes only `.jpg` files and excludes everything else during synchronization.

#### 6. Performing a Dry Run
```bash
rsync -av --dry-run /source/directory/ /destination/directory/
```
This command performs a dry run to show what changes would be made without actually transferring any files.

#### 7. Showing Progress During Transfer
```bash
rsync -avP /source/directory/ /destination/directory/
```
This command shows the progress of the file transfer and keeps partially transferred files in case the process is interrupted.
