The use of a 1x1 convolutional kernel in deep learning, often referred to as a "network-in-network" or "bottleneck" layer, serves several important purposes and has proven to be quite useful in various convolutional neural network (CNN) architectures. 

## How it works

And as mentioned, it could lead to dimension reduction, so how does it actually work?

Let's assume there is a picture with a size of  28x28 pixels, and it's colorful, so it has 3 **channels** (RGB). And now we can use a kernel with a size of 5x5x3. Every channel in the picture will do a convolution only on their corresponding channel. That means we will actually get a result like **m**x**m**x3, while **m** means the size of one channel of the picture after doing convolution. After this, we will add them together, thus forming a result like **m**x**m**x1, where the results of three channels are added together. Thus if we have **n** kernels, we will let it become the new channels, which means stack it as **m**x**m**x**n**. That is why we could successfully do a dimension change in the respective of channel.

## Why we use it

1. **Dimensionality Reduction and Channel Compression:** One of the primary reasons for using 1x1 convolutions is to reduce the dimensionality of the feature maps. By applying a 1x1 convolution with a smaller number of output channels (also known as feature maps or filters), you can effectively reduce the number of computations and parameters in subsequent layers, which can lead to faster training and inference times. This helps in making the network more computationally efficient.
2. **Feature Interaction and Non-Linearity:** Even though the convolutional kernel is 1x1 in size, it allows for interactions between different channels of the input feature map. Each output channel is a weighted sum of the input channels, which enables the network to learn complex relationships and feature interactions in a multi-channel manner. Additionally, the application of non-linear activation functions after the 1x1 convolution introduces non-linearity into the network, enhancing its representational power.
3. **Network Depth and Capacity Control:** 1x1 convolutions provide a way to control the capacity of the network without significantly increasing the computational load. By inserting 1x1 convolutions between larger convolutional layers, you can adjust the number of feature maps and effectively control the depth and complexity of the network. This can help prevent overfitting and make the network easier to train.
4. **Improving Information Flow and Mixing:** 1x1 convolutions can serve as a mechanism for mixing information across channels. They can enhance the network's ability to capture and propagate important features through the network. This is particularly helpful in situations where different channels contain complementary or distinct information.
